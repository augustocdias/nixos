# UI Prototype

Generate **several radically different UI variations** on a single route, switchable from a floating bottom bar. The user flips between variants in the browser, picks one (or steals bits from each), then throws the rest away.

If the question is about logic/state rather than what something looks like, this is the wrong branch. Use [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md).

## When this is the right shape

- "What should this page look like?"
- "I want to see a few options for this dashboard before committing."
- "Try a different layout for the settings screen."
- Any time the user would otherwise spend a day picking between three vague mockups in their head.

## Two sub-shapes: strongly prefer sub-shape A

A UI prototype is much easier to judge when it's **butting up against the rest of the app**: real header, real sidebar, real data, real density. Default to sub-shape A whenever there's a plausible existing page to host the variants. Keep prototype source and retained captures under `<absolute-workspace>/prototypes/<slug>/`; temporary application wiring uses the authorized development checkout and is removed before implementation commits.

### Sub-shape A: adjustment to an existing page (preferred)

The route already exists. Variants render **on the same route**, gated by a `?variant=` URL search param. Existing data fetching, params, and auth stay. Only rendering swaps. If a new section, card, or step naturally belongs inside an existing page, mount the variants there too.

### Sub-shape B: a new page (last resort)

Only use this when the prototype genuinely has no existing page to live inside. Create a clearly marked throwaway route using the project's routing convention and the same `?variant=` pattern. Keep its implementation in the workspace with temporary route wiring in the authorized checkout.

Before choosing B, check whether an existing page could host it. If actual application integration is unavailable, disclose the missing data, auth, and routing coverage instead of claiming an isolated preview proves it.

In both shapes the floating bottom bar is identical.

## Process

### 1. State the question and pick N

Default to **3 variants**. More than 5 stops being radically different and starts being noise, so cap there.

Write down the plan in one line, in the prototype's location or a top-of-file comment:

> "Three variants of the settings page, switchable via `?variant=`, on the existing `/settings` route."

This works whether the user is here to push back or not.

### 2. Generate radically different variants

Draft each variant. Hold each one to:

- The page's purpose and the data it has access to.
- The project's component library / styling system (TailwindCSS, shadcn, MUI, plain CSS, whatever).
- A clear exported component name, e.g. `VariantA`, `VariantB`, `VariantC`.

Variants must be **structurally different**: different layout, different information hierarchy, different primary affordance, not just different colours. Three slightly-tweaked card grids isn't a UI prototype, it's wallpaper. If two drafts come out too similar, redo one with explicit "do not use a card grid" guidance.

### 3. Wire them together

Create a single switcher component on the route:

```tsx
// pseudo-code, adapt to the project's framework
const variant = searchParams.get('variant') ?? 'A';
return (
  <>
    {variant === 'A' && <VariantA {...data} />}
    {variant === 'B' && <VariantB {...data} />}
    {variant === 'C' && <VariantC {...data} />}
    <PrototypeSwitcher variants={['A','B','C']} current={variant} />
  </>
);
```

For sub-shape A (existing page): keep all existing data fetching above the switcher; only the rendered subtree changes per variant.

For sub-shape B (new page): the throwaway route mounts the same switcher.

### 4. Build the floating switcher

A small fixed-position bar at the bottom-centre of the screen with three pieces:

- **Left arrow**: cycles to the previous variant (wraps around).
- **Variant label**: shows the current variant key and, if the variant exports a name, that name too. e.g. `B (Sidebar layout)`.
- **Right arrow**: cycles forward (wraps around).

Behaviour:

- Clicking an arrow updates the URL search param (use the framework's router, e.g. `router.replace` on Next, `navigate` on React Router, etc) so the variant is shareable and reload-stable.
- Keyboard: `←` and `→` arrow keys also cycle. Don't intercept arrow keys when an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `[contenteditable]` is focused.
- Visually distinct from the page (e.g. high-contrast pill, subtle shadow) so it's obviously not part of the design being evaluated.
- Hidden in production builds: gate on `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` or an equivalent check, so a stray prototype merge can't ship the bar to users.

Put the switcher in one shared prototype component under the workspace prototype directory. Reuse it through temporary application wiring, not a permanent production shared-UI addition.

### 5. Hand it over

Surface the URL (and the `?variant=` keys). The user will flip through whenever they get to it. The interesting feedback is usually **"I want the header from B with the sidebar from C"**, which is the actual design they want.

### 6. Capture the answer and clean up

Once a variant has won, record which variant and why in `<absolute-workspace>/prototypes/<slug>/result.md`. Retain all variants and the switcher beside it as the primary source rather than publishing an artifact branch.

- **Sub-shape A**: fold the winner into the existing page within the requested implementation scope.
- **Sub-shape B**: promote the winner to a real route within that scope.

Use production tests, error handling, and review for the selected change. Remove losing variants, switchers, and temporary route/task wiring from the application before implementation commits. Keep all experimental sources and captures local; only the selected production code, tests, and task-required production documentation belong in those commits.

## Anti-patterns

- **Variants that differ only in colour or copy.** That's a tweak, not a prototype. Real variants disagree about structure.
- **Sharing too much code between variants.** A shared `<Header>` is fine; a shared `<Layout>` defeats the point. Each variant should be free to throw out the layout.
- **Wiring variants to real mutations.** Read-only prototypes are fine. If a variant needs to mutate, point it at a stub: the question is "what should this look like", not "does the backend work".
- **Promoting the prototype directly to production.** The variant code was written under prototype constraints (no tests, minimal error handling). Rewrite it properly when you fold it in.
